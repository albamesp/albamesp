title: Mapping the Unmapped - Mapping for Environment:A crow-sourced mapping application
---
Today I came across this amazing initiative [mapforenvironment.org](https://mapforenvironment.org/)in the boundary between environmental activism and mapping geek-ness. 
I couldn't be writing about anything else right now!

It is a crow-sourcing platform where A community of volunteers from all over the world join forces to help protecting the forests, rivers, plains... all over the world! 

Map for Environment combines OpenStreetMap mapping tools with open-source satellite imagery and location data of known logging, industrial agriculture, dam, and fracking locations to create 
detailed maps of infrastructure, size, as well as communities impacted. Mapped data is shared on OpenStreetMap b the users and will also
 available on [Maphubs](http://maphubs.com).
