title: Mapping for Environment: A crow-sourced mapping application
---
Today I came across this amazing initiative [mapforenvironment.org](https://mapforenvironment.org/), lying at the boundary between environmental activism and mapping geekness. Obviously I couldn't be writing about anything else right now!

Mapping for Environment is a crow-sourcing platform where a community of volunteers join forces to help protecting the forests, rivers, plains... all over the world! They have to look at satellite imagery and identify features such as roads, buildings, etc...

Map for Environment combines OpenStreetMap mapping tools with open-source satellite imagery and location data of known logging, industrial agriculture, dam, and fracking locations to create detailed maps of infrastructure, size, as well as communities impacted. Mapped data is shared on OpenStreetMap b the users and will also  available on [Maphubs](http://maphubs.com).

If you want to help you only need to create an account on OpenStreetMap and follow one of the short and straigh-forward tutorials that will help you through the process. No previous experience at mapping is required. There are different [projects](https://tasks.mapforenvironment.org/) where you can collaborate, give it a go, start mapping and make a difference!
