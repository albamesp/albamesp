title: Glacier delineation from ASTER images using PCI Geomatica and ArcGIS 
---

(post in preparation)

Step 1: Preparing data

A- Combining information

The aim of this spectral bands combination is to get a high contrast between glacier ice and rocks, water of any other feature in the image. 
Our source of information is an image derived from ASTER. It is compounded by several bands of information, each one representing  one range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Therefore, we have different information storage and spread in different bands. In order to be able to work with different info (different bands)it is necessary to combine them. Band combination will use different algorithms depending on what is convenient to be highlighted. Most frequent ones are the division of two spectral bands (often called band ratio) (e.g. band 4/band 3) or index as Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) which is based on differences in spectral properties of snow in VIS and MIR.
This step can be implemented on PCI, under “Modelling” mode, and using ARI function. Also in ARCGIS with the tool “raster calculator*”. 
*To implement raster operations with ArcGIS, it will be necessary to do it under “floating” number-types.

B-	Filtering
After band combination is convenient to implement a filter. Filtering will remove the noise and will make the image smoother. 
There are different types of filters, but for this case, I will recommend to use a low pass filter as median or average. 
After filtering, the image will be more consistent, and different features will have stronger frontiers. Also debris-patches can be removed. 
PCI Geomatica offers a wide variety of filters (FME,FAC,FGA...), although is also possible in ArcGIS.

Step 2- Glaciers from its brightness value

A-	Thresolding (Reclassify)

Every feature represented in the ASTER image has a representative range of brightness value. Therefore ice can be easily distinguished from the rock or from the water.  
Difficulties can arise in shadow-areas, clouds, ice with high impurity content and specially debris cover on glaciers. In such cases manual correction is necessary. 
From this step, the work will be developed in ArcGis. The most important fact is to choose a good threshold number to separate ice from the other elements in the image.
 This number will depend on the spectral bands -or combination of them- we are working. Once the threshold is established, using Reclassify function on ArcGIS you can give
 a distinctive value to all pixels whose brightness is within the range chosen. The rest of pixels will have a different value so they could be deleted.
 Converting the resulting raster into a polygon, you will obtain the “mask” for all the glaciated part of the image.

B-	Automatic Classification in PCI
This is a semiautomatic process developed in PCI Geomatica which consists in providing the software information about the “signatures” of the different features present 
in the ASTER image. Then, the software is able to identify the areas with similar signatures (or pixel values). The output of automatic classification is similar 
to thresholding, but here is not necessary to find threshold values. For more [information see](http://www.sc.chula.ac.th/courseware/2309507/Lecture/remote18.htm)
With supervised classification, we identify examples of the Information classes (i.e., land cover type) of interest in the image. 
These are called "training sites". The image processing software system is then used to develop a statistical characterization of the reflectance for each information class. 
This stage is often called "signature analysis" and may involve developing a characterization as simple as the mean or the rage of reflectance on each bands, 
or as complex as detailed analyses of the mean, variances and covariance over all bands. Once a statistical characterization has been achieved for each information class,
 the image is then classified by examining the reflectance for each pixel and making a decision about which of the signatures it resembles most. 
Maximum likelihood Classification is a statistical decision criterion to assist in the classification of overlapping signatures; pixels are assigned to the class of highest probability. 
The maximum likelihood classifier is considered to give more accurate
results than parallelepiped classification however it is much slower due to extra computations. We put the word `accurate' in quotes because this assumes that classes in the input data have a Gaussian distribution and that signatures were well selected; this is not always a safe assumption.

Step 3- Basins generation from DEM
In this step, the aim is separate individual glaciers from the big polygon that contains all the glaciated area  obtained in the previous step.  It will be not be possible to do this in a total automatic procedure. However we will try to do it as much as possible. 
A Digital Elevation Model of the area covered by the ASTER image is needed. 
A-	Filling out the holes
Holes are often in DEMs due to errors during the interpolation. For a 30-meter resolution DEMs, Tarboton et al (1991), found that from 0.9 to 4.7 percent of the cells in a DEM were sinks. The mean adjustment of these sinks ranged from 2.6 to 4.8 meters. This means that for a 1,000 by 1,000 cell grid (1 million cells), there may be 9,000 to 47,000 sinks to be filled. Other DEM data sources may have higher or lower percentages of sinks, depending on how the surfaces were processed. This holes, therefore, are not natural sinks but mistakes that should be removed to ensure proper delineation of basins and streams. This is done in ArcGis using the fill function which iterates different algorithms until all holes (whose depth can fixed) are filled. Determining the depth at which a hole can be considered a natural sink is important Flow direction
Flow direction tool creates a raster of flow direction from each cell to its steepest downslope neighbor. It takes as input the raster after filling holes.
B-	Basins
The Basin tool delineates drainage basins by identifying ridge lines between basins. Basin analyzes the flow direction raster to find all sets of connected cells that belong to the same drainage basin. The drainage basins are created by locating the pour points at the edges of the Analysis window (where water would pour out of the raster), as well as sinks, then identifying the contributing area above each pour point. This results in a raster of drainage basins.
I obtained the best result by filling holes with automatic iteration –depth 100 m-(quick) and with depth=75 m. Created flow direction raster and basins for both of them  and I merged the results.
The last step consist just in a Raster to Polygon conversion of the final output (basins). And a final union of the big polygon of glaciated area and basins. This union will be carried out through Split or Intersect functions: Basins (as the main, firs layer) intersected/splited with glaciers. The outputs from this  will give a first approximation to glaciers delineation, however, for singular glacier delineation, manual rupture will be necessary.

Step 4- Accuracy Assessment
In order to determine the accuracy of the supervised classification (or any other automatic classification) of the pixels with glacier content. This process, though possible in PCI, is easier and more clear if developed in IDRISI, by using the function Crosstabulation.
Two main layers are needed: on one hand the layer with the result from automatic classification (the feature to be evaluated) and on the other hand, the “mask” or, let’s say, the true data to be contrasted with.
Two different types of errors can occurred: it could be that some pixels misclassified as glacier at the automatic layer, but they belong to other class at the real mask. In this case we referrer to “user accuracy” or error by  commission. It could also happen that, due to moraine cover, for example, some real glacier pixel are considered rock at the automatic classification layer. This will lead to error for omission and it is measured as the “producer’s accuracy”.
The producer's accuracy relates to the probability that a reference sample (photo-interpreted land cover class in this project) will be correctly mapped and measures the errors of omission (7-2 producer's accuracy). In contrast, the user's accuracy indicates the probability that a sample from land cover map actually matches what it is from the reference data (photo-interpreted land cover class in this project) and measures the error of commission (7-1user's accuracy).
The difference between producer’s and user’s accuracy is the difference between defining accuracy in terms of how well the landscape can be mapped (producer’s accuracy) versus how reliable the classification map is to the user (user’s accuracy; Story & Congalton 1986).

The [Kappa statistic](http://www.jennessent.com/downloads/Kappa_Manual_Online.pdf)
The Kappa statistic is used to measure the agreement between two sets of categorizations of a dataset while correcting for chance agreements between the categories. It provides a measure of agreement between the predicted values and the observed values.
The Kappa statistic makes use of both the overall accuracy of the model and the accuracies within each category, both in terms of the predictive model and the field-surveyed sample points, to correct for chance agreement between categories.
The ˆK statistic typically ranges between 0 and 1, with values closest to 1 reflecting highest
agreement. Negative values are possible but rare.

It will be calculated with IDRISI!
