title: Basins generation from DEM (using PCI Geomatica and ArcGIS)
---

(post in preparation)

The aim the aim is separate individual glaciers from the big polygon that contains all the glaciated area  obtained in the previous step.  It will be not be possible to do this in a total automatic procedure. However we will try to do it as much as possible.
A Digital Elevation Model of the area covered by the ASTER image is needed.
A-	Filling out the holes
Holes are often in DEMs due to errors during the interpolation. For a 30-meter resolution DEMs, Tarboton et al (1991), found that from 0.9 to 4.7 percent of the cells in a DEM were sinks. The mean adjustment of these sinks ranged from 2.6 to 4.8 meters. This means that for a 1,000 by 1,000 cell grid (1 million cells), there may be 9,000 to 47,000 sinks to be filled. Other DEM data sources may have higher or lower percentages of sinks, depending on how the surfaces were processed. This holes, therefore, are not natural sinks but mistakes that should be removed to ensure proper delineation of basins and streams. This is done in ArcGis using the fill function which iterates different algorithms until all holes (whose depth can fixed) are filled. Determining the depth at which a hole can be considered a natural sink is important Flow direction
Flow direction tool creates a raster of flow direction from each cell to its steepest downslope neighbor. It takes as input the raster after filling holes.
B-	Basins
The Basin tool delineates drainage basins by identifying ridge lines between basins. Basin analyzes the flow direction raster to find all sets of connected cells that belong to the same drainage basin. The drainage basins are created by locating the pour points at the edges of the Analysis window (where water would pour out of the raster), as well as sinks, then identifying the contributing area above each pour point. This results in a raster of drainage basins.
I obtained the best result by filling holes with automatic iteration –depth 100 m-(quick) and with depth=75 m. Created flow direction raster and basins for both of them  and I merged the results.
The last step consist just in a Raster to Polygon conversion of the final output (basins). And a final union of the big polygon of glaciated area and basins. This union will be carried out through Split or Intersect functions: Basins (as the main, firs layer) intersected/splited with glaciers. The outputs from this  will give a first approximation to glaciers delineation, however, for singular glacier delineation, manual rupture will be necessary.

Step 4- Accuracy Assessment
In order to determine the accuracy of the supervised classification (or any other automatic classification) of the pixels with glacier content. This process, though possible in PCI, is easier and more clear if developed in IDRISI, by using the function Crosstabulation.
Two main layers are needed: on one hand the layer with the result from automatic classification (the feature to be evaluated) and on the other hand, the “mask” or, let’s say, the true data to be contrasted with.
Two different types of errors can occurred: it could be that some pixels misclassified as glacier at the automatic layer, but they belong to other class at the real mask. In this case we referrer to “user accuracy” or error by  commission. It could also happen that, due to moraine cover, for example, some real glacier pixel are considered rock at the automatic classification layer. This will lead to error for omission and it is measured as the “producer’s accuracy”.
The producer's accuracy relates to the probability that a reference sample (photo-interpreted land cover class in this project) will be correctly mapped and measures the errors of omission (7-2 producer's accuracy). In contrast, the user's accuracy indicates the probability that a sample from land cover map actually matches what it is from the reference data (photo-interpreted land cover class in this project) and measures the error of commission (7-1user's accuracy).
The difference between producer’s and user’s accuracy is the difference between defining accuracy in terms of how well the landscape can be mapped (producer’s accuracy) versus how reliable the classification map is to the user (user’s accuracy; Story & Congalton 1986).

The [Kappa statistic](http://www.jennessent.com/downloads/Kappa_Manual_Online.pdf)
The Kappa statistic is used to measure the agreement between two sets of categorizations of a dataset while correcting for chance agreements between the categories. It provides a measure of agreement between the predicted values and the observed values.
The Kappa statistic makes use of both the overall accuracy of the model and the accuracies within each category, both in terms of the predictive model and the field-surveyed sample points, to correct for chance agreement between categories.
The ˆK statistic typically ranges between 0 and 1, with values closest to 1 reflecting highest
agreement. Negative values are possible but rare.

It will be calculated with IDRISI!
