Monte Carlo modelling projects the loss of most land-terminating glaciers on Svalbard in the 21st century under RCP 8.5 forcing

The high Arctic archipelagos around the globe are among the most strongly ice-covered landscapes on Earth apart from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.
In the recent past, the European Arctic archipelago of Svalbard has shown the least negative glacier mass balance (mass gains over mass losses) of all the high Arctic regions, which, in general,
contributed substantially to global sea level rise over the past decades. However, as we find in this study, it is likely that this picture will change substantially in the future, as the region around Svalbard is thought 
to experience the strongest climate warming over all the Arctic until the end of the 21st century. 
Here we present extensive Monte Carlo simulations of the future ice-mass evolution of 29 individual land-terminating glaciers on the Svalbard archipelago under an RCP 8.5 climate forcing,
a rather pessimistic future climate scenario that we seem to be currently heading for, though.  

By using a topography-based extrapolation of the simulation results to the entire archipelago we show that a complete loss of most of Svalbard's land-terminating glaciers and even a deglaciation of certain subregions 
of the archipelago might occur before the end of the 21st century if global warming continues along the course of RCP 8.5. In this case, 98% of the land-terminating glaciers will have retreated to less than one tenth of
their initial extent by 2100!
