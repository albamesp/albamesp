Interests

My reseach interests lie at the frontier between environmental sciences, algorithm development for big data analysis and GIS-related solutions. 

Check my [blog](http://albamesp.github.io/) and my [Github page] (https://github.com/albamesp) to find out my on-going code development projects.

## Past projects

Past projects include:
- Supervised classification algorithms for image processing
- Feature-tracking algorithms to obtain surface velocity fields for a glacier in Alaska
- Multivariate regression models for sea-level rise problems
- Glacier bedrock topography through the compilation of ice-penetrating radar and satellite digital elevation models of glaciers in Svalbard
