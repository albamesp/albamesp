Interests

I'm a glaciologist working on Antarctica using satellite data. 

I've a keen interest in geospatial problem solving and environmental spatio-temporal relationships - most of my work and development is carried out using [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
Check my [blog](../post) to find out about some of the geo-related problems I have worked over these years as well as tips and tricks relating to on-going code development.

## Past projects

Past projects include:

- glacier bedrock topography through the compilation of ice-penetrating radar and satellite digital elevation models
- supervised classification algorithms for image processing
- feature-tracking algorithms to obtain surface velocity fields for a glacier in Alaska
- Multivariate regression models for sea-level rise problems
