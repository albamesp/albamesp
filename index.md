My current project aims to determining the time evolving global contribution of ice to the oceans, the individual factors affecting sea level change and glacio isostatic adjustment, simultaneously.

## Interests
My research interests lie at the boundary between environmental sciences, analysis of big data analysis and development of geospatial solutions and visualizations. 

Check my [blog](http://albamesp.github.io/) and my [Github page](https://github.com/albamesp) to find out about my on-going code development projects.

## Past projects

Past projects include:

- Supervised classification algorithms for image processing
- Feature-tracking algorithms to obtain surface velocity fields for a glacier in Alaska
- Multivariate regression models for sea-level rise problems
- Glacier bedrock topography through the compilation of ice-penetrating radar and satellite digital elevation models of glaciers in Svalbard
