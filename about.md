I am a researcher at the Bristol Glaciology Center, University of Bristol, UK. My research focuses on the study
of the Antarctic Ice Sheet using satellite observations. I use a variety of space geodetic and in situ observations
to investigate changes in the Antarctic system and their relationship to climate change.

## Overview

I have started this site with the purpose of keeping information, code and papers available to anyone interested. Have a look to my [Github page](https://github.com/albamesp).
Research interests: Geospatial analysis, spatio-temporal modelling, remote sensing, GIS, climate change, glaciers, geostatistics, Open source, [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
