Position: Postdoctoral researcher in Glaciology

Research interests: Geospatial analysis, Remote sensing, GIS, Glaciers, Geostatistics, Open source, Python development, R

## Overview

I'm a glaciologist working on Antarctica using satellite data. 

I've a keen interest in geospatial problem solving and environmental spatio-temporal relationships - most of my work and development is carried out using [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Check out my [blog](../blog) for information on current geo-related solutions as well as tips and tricks relating to on-going code development.

## Past projects

Past projects include:

- glacier reconstruction through the compilation of old (topographic maps) and new datasets (contemporary field surveys)
- spatially distributed grid based mass balance modelling ([here's a model you can play with](https://github.com/Chris35Wills/SEB_model_java_files))
- automated assessment of crevasse patterns for assessing crevasse evolution
- hypersepctral image analysis over tidewater glaciers to identify presence of water 
- glacier surface velocity mapping using elevation data

## Contact me

Feel free to get in touch - I'm always interested in collaborating or if you have any questions about my work.
